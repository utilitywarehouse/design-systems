Thank you for your interest in contributing to UW Native UI!
This project is made possible by contributors like you, and we welcome any

- [Making Changes](#making-changes)
- [Documentation Contributions](#documentation-contributions)

## Getting Started

Run setup in the root of the repo. This will install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/),
which we use to manage this monorepo.

**Make sure you're using node v18+ before running the below commands**

```
npm run setup
```

Next, install install dependencies across all packages, and build the local
packages.

```
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

## Linting

This will run ESLint & prettier across all packages, and take advantage of turborepo's caching.

```
pnpm lint
```

To fix linting & formatting issues, run:

```
pnpm lint:fix
```

To run lint & build with turborepo:

```
pnpm run checks
```

## Making Changes

Pull requests are encouraged. If you want to add a feature or fix a bug:

1. Clone this repository
1. [Create a separate branch](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-branches)
   for your changes
1. Make your changes, and ensure they are formatted by
   [Prettier](https://prettier.io), a pre-commit hook will ensure linting &
   formatting checks pass
1. Create a changeset by running `pnpm changeset`. [More info](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/adding-a-changeset.md).
1. Push your branch and open a PR ðŸš€

## Documentation Contributions

There are a number of ways you can add documentation for components and for more general information.

## Changesets

UW Native UI uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for
versioning, publishing and automating changelogs. This means that you need to
add a changeset by running `pnpm changeset`, you will then be prompted to select
which package(s) to include in the changeset, and then a bump type from `major`,
`minor` or `patch`, and finally you will need to add a message to be included in
the next release and associated changelog.

Not all changes require changesets, so Pull Requests are not blocked if missing
a changeset, however you may be asked to add one, or one may be added for your
change.
