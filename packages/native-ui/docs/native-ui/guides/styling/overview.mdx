# Styling Overview

Styling is provided by our styling library [`react-native-unistyles`](https://www.unistyl.es/start/introduction/) it is configured by passing theme files to
the `react-native-unistyles` runtime instanciated by the `@utilitywarehouse/native-ui` `NativeUIProvider` (a Wrapper component that applies the theme and
styling to all the children).

```tsx
import { NativeUIProvider } from '../../';

function App({ children }) {
  return <NativeUIProvider>{children}</NativeUIProvider>;
}
```

Our `NativeUIProvider` handles changes in color modes along with the `react-native-unistyles` runtime. For more information on how to use the `react-native-unistyles`
runtime, please refer to the [documentation](https://www.unistyl.es/start/introduction).
