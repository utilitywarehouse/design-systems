# useStyles

Hook that ties everything together and handles the heavy lifting.

Without useStyles, you can't utilise features like:

- breakpoints
- media queries
- themes
- variants

It can be imported from the `@utilitywarehouse/native-ui` package:

```tsx
import { useStyles } from '../../';
```

useStyles accepts two optional arguments: stylesheet and variants.

To learn more about variants [follow this guide](https://www.unistyl.es/reference/variants/).

## Basic usage (no arguments)

If you need to access your `theme` or the current `breakpoint` in your component you can call useStyles without any arguments:

```tsx
const { theme, breakpoint } = useStyles();
```

## Basic usage (stylesheet)

For more advanced usage, pass your stylesheet generated with `createStyleSheet`:

```tsx
// you can still access theme and current breakpoint
const { styles, theme, breakpoint } = useStyles(stylesheet);
```

> Note:
> The styles object is compatible with any React Native component and satisfy the TypeScript type requirements. It also means that you can mix styles with other libraries like Reanimated.

## Basic usage (breakpoint)

The `breakpoint` will be defined string as `base`, `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg` or `xl`.

With `breakpoint` you can manipulate the JSX to hide or show some components:

```tsx
export const Example = () => {
  const { styles, breakpoint } = useStyles(stylesheet)

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
        <Hidden
            from="xs"
            to="md"
            breakpoint={breakpoint}
        >
          <MobileSidebar />
        </Hidden>
        <Visible
          from="md"
          breakpoint={breakpoint}
        >
          <WebSidebar />
        </Hidden>
    </View>
  )
}
```

### Basic usage (theme)

Sometimes, you may need to access your `theme` values outside of the stylesheet. An example of this could be when working with a built-in React Native Button component.

The values of `theme` come from the [theme tokens](/docs/native-ui-guides-styling-theme-tokens--docs).

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'react-native';
import { useStyles } from '../../';

export const Example = () => {
  const { theme } = useStyles();

  return <Button color={theme.colors.cyan100} title="Click me" onPress={() => {}} />;
};
```
