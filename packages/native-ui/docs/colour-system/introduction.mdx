# UW Colour System

Colour scales for building UW Native UIs.

Current version: v{version}

## Installation

```console
yarn add @utilitywarehouse/colour-system
```

## Usage

The colour system package exports 3 _color_ objects, `colors` is the default
colour scales for light mode, and `colorsDark` is colour scales for dark mode,
used in native mobile applications. The `colorsCommon` object includes semantic
brand & service colours used across both light & dark modes.

```tsx
import { colors, colorsDark, colorsCommon } from '@utilitywarehouse/colour-system'

[...]

<Box color={isDarkMode ? colors.grey500 : colorsDark.grey500} />

[...]

<Box bgcolor={colorsCommon.serviceBroadband} />
<Box bgcolor={colorsCommon.brandPrimaryPurple} />
```

## Semantic naming

The long term intention is to abstract meanings/semantic names for the colour
scales. The Colour System is shared over many projects and so we need to be
mindful of the flexibility of usage. Therefore, for now, we are using
presentational naming conventions and not aliases or semantic tokens. When the
Colour System has more maturity, and we can see repeated patterns of colour
usage, then we can begin to define some default and semantic colours for usage
such as backgrounds, text, borders, intention etc.
