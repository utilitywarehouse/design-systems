# Spinner

Using a Spinner is a common method for indicating that an asynchronous process is ongoing. Additionally, it informs users that they should refrain from clicking or tapping the UI until the loading state has been resolved.

## Playground

<Canvas of={Stories.Playground} />

<Controls of={Stories.Playground} />

## Usage

The Spinner can be used independently (it's a self-contained component) or in conjunction with other components,
such as in the loading state of a `Button` or `Input` Search retrieving data. It can also be used inside a `Dialog`
with text, or directly in a container on the screen when we want the user to wait and avoid performing any actions.

<UsageWrap>
  <Center>
    <Spinner size="sm" color={colors.cyan400} />
  </Center>
</UsageWrap>

```tsx
import { Spinner, Center } from '@utilitywarehouse/native-ui';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <Center>
    <Spinner size="sm" color={colors.cyan400} />
  </Center>
);
```
