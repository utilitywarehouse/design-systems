# UW Colour System SCSS variables

A selected group of colour-system colour scales are available as SCSS
variables. This includes the light mode colour scales, and the common colour
scales. These are the only ones included as there are no plans to support dark
mode on the web, and no plans to use SCSS in the native mobile apps.

## Usage

When you have the colour-system package installed, you need to import the `_colours.scss` file in the root of your project.

```js
import '@utilitywarehouse/colour-system/scss/_colours.scss';
```

You can then reference the colours in your SCSS.

```css
.electricity {
  background-color: $serviceElectricity;
  border: 1px solid $apple900;
}
```
