## Current Status

Web UI is now in **Maintenance mode**, meaning there will be no new features or
breaking changes. New releases will only be made to support critical bug fixes
or security maintenance updates.

We are currently prioritising work on the new Hearth Design Systems libraries.

## Installation

Assuming you already have React installed, to get started install the library and it's peer dependencies.

```console
yarn add @utilitywarehouse/web-ui @mui/material
```

## Additional packages

You will need to include the **Aeonik** and **Work Sans** fonts. The
easiest way to do this is to use the `@utilitywarehouse/fontsource` package.

```console
yarn add @utilitywarehouse/fontsource
```

We also recommend you use the `@utilitywarehouse/css-reset` package as Web UI does
not include a CSS reset by default.

```console
yarn add @utilitywarehouse/css-reset
```

If using, import both packages in the root of your application.

```js
import '@utilitywarehouse/css-reset';
import '@utilitywarehouse/fontsource';
```

## Theming

Newer components do not need to be wrapped in a `ThemeProvider` component.

You only need to use the `ThemeProvider` component in your app if you are using
the deprecated `Grid` component.

All other components can be used without being wrapped in a `ThemeProvider`,
and will not be affected if wrapped in a `ThemeProvider` from another
component library, including the deprecated `customer-ui-material` library.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@utilitywarehouse/web-ui';
import App from './App';

const App: React.FC = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

## Usage with MUI Material

If you are already using the `@mui/material` package in your app, then it's
likely you can't also use Web UI. We override the default MUI theme and types
and this can cause conflicts with your existing setup.

This should hopefully be resolved in `v2`.

## ES modules

In an effort to provide a tree-shakeable library we export bundles for both ES
modules and CommonJS. This however may cause issues with Webpack based
applications as they default to expecting ES module files to be referenced with
a file extension.

### Plain React App

If you are using Web UI in a plain React app, you can update [this rule](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#resolvefullyspecified).

```js
{
  test: /\.m?js/,
  resolve: {
    fullySpecified: false,
  },
},
```

### Create React App

If you are using Create React App the process is almost the same, but you will
have to install `react-app-rewired` (or any other package that let's you edit
the build process). In this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70720290) you can see exactly what
is needed (As the example provided solves exactly this issue coincidentally).

### Next.js

If you are using Next.js this won't happen to you as it is handled by the framework.

## Dark Mode

It should be noted that there is no intention to support dark mode for web.

## End of Life

These are the current support timelines for major version releases. Only until
these dates will we continue to provide bug fixes and support.

- `v1`: Current version
- `v0`: EOL 01/04/2025
