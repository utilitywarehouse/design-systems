## Alternatives

- Flex: Prefer `Flex` for stacked layouts.

## Flex vs. Stack

The `Stack` component was introduced before the flexbox `gap` property was
widely available, and was intended as an intuitive way of building consistently
spaced layouts. It did this by adding additional margin to child components,
which could sometimes cause problems, such as margin collapse on the child
components.

It is now possible to achieve the same layouts using the native flexbox gap
property, and this is our preferred way of achieving these common _stacked_
layouts. The `Stack` component will be deprecated and removed in due course.

## Accessibility

The `Stack` component is an all purpose component. By default, it has no
accessibility concerns. If you use the `Stack` as a custom element, it is up to
you to manage the resulting accessibility implications.

## Implementation

By default `Stack` uses margins to create space between children. You can
change this to use the flexbox gap property with the `useFlexGap` boolean
prop.
