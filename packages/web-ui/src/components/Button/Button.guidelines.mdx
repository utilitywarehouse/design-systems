## Accessibility

- **If it does something it's a button, if it goes somewhere it's a link.**
- If you need help deciding which component works best for your content, please refer to the [global usage guidelines](https://wiki.uw.systems/posts/buttons-links-and-icon-buttons-guidelines-fs09gshh).
- All buttons, except solid cyan, meet WCAG AA colour contrast standards on a white background.
- Text within a button is also crucial for [accessibility and usability](https://wiki.uw.systems/posts/buttons-links-and-icon-buttons-guidelines-fs09gshh).

## Variants

Buttons, like many other components, come in pre-designed variants. For more
information on style variant concepts, refer to the [naming convention doc](https://wiki.uw.systems/posts/naming-conventions-and-stack-mirroring-z1olqysr#hco7u-variants).

The Button component offers a set of variants to address a wide variety of use
cases. Each variant provides control over its appearance, including elements
like borders, background colour, and foreground colours.

The choice of Button variant depends on several factors:

- Where does the button appear in the user flow?
- The importance of the action within that context
- How does the button interact with other elements on the screen?

### Solid

Solid Buttons are ideal for primary actions in screens or compositions that
require high visual emphasis. Their appearance creates a strong presence,
making them perfect for highlighting the main action especially when combined
with other Button variants to create a clear visual hierarchy within a
composition.

Solid buttons are ideal for submitting data in forms, such as
submitting an application or finalising a purchase.

### Outline

Outline Buttons offer a moderate level of emphasis, making them suitable for
secondary or non-critical actions like "Cancel" or "Edit." To enhance the
meaning and purpose of the action further, these buttons can be combined with
any colorScheme from our design system.

<Canvas of={Stories.OutlineVariantDesignExample} sourceState="none" />

### Ghost

Ghost buttons are a subtle button variant designed to have a low visual presence compared to other Button variants.

Ghost buttons start out with a transparent look, only becoming fully visible when a user interacts with them.
Typical use cases of the ghost variant are:

- Suitable for actions that are less important than the primary one on a screen:
- Ghost buttons excel at complementing solid and outlined Buttons by providing additional actions without overwhelming users.
- Their simple design makes them ideal as building blocks for other UI components that require user interaction, such as Input, Tiles, Calendar, etc.

To enhance the meaning and purpose of the action further, these buttons can be combined with any colorScheme from our design system.

<Canvas of={Stories.GhostVariantDesignExample} sourceState="none" />

## Colour Schemes

The `colorScheme` prop determines the colours applied to the Button component.
These colour schemes are visually defined within the design system, and not all
Button variants support every available colour scheme as they are tailored to
specific use cases.

Choosing a colour scheme that aligns with the intended meaning of the user
action (e.g. success, warning) can enhance the user experience. If no
colour scheme is specified, the default scheme is cyan.

The choice of colour scheme and button variant depends on several factors:

- The context in which the button is used.
- How critical is the action triggered by the button.
- The importance of the action within that context.
- The relationship between the Button and other elements in the composition.

To learn more about the colour schemes please refer to the
[naming conventions document](https://wiki.uw.systems/posts/naming-conventions-and-stack-mirroring-z1olqysr#hz3pw-color-schemes).

### Cyan

**By default, cyan is used for primary actions to signify their importance.**

However, it's important to remember that different visual weight and hierarchy
in a composition can be achieved using button variants. Depending on
the hierarchy of the action within the context of your design, you may want to
consider using a different button variant to either emphasise or de-emphasise
the importance of an action.

<Canvas of={Stories.CyanColorSchemeDesignExample} sourceState="none" />

### Red

**Red is the most suitable button colour scheme for destructive actions.**

These actions can result in data loss, are irreversible, or have significant
negative consequences for the user. The red colour serves as a strong visual
warning, prompting users to carefully consider such actions due to their
potential impact.

**The importance and potential consequences of a destructive action can be
further emphasised, or reduced, depending on the impact and context of your
design.**

This can be achieved by using different button variants in relation to other
actions. For instance, a solid red button might be used for a highly
destructive action, while a red ghost Button, or a red outline Button could be
used for a less impactful one.

<Canvas of={Stories.RedColorSchemeDesignExample} sourceState="none" />

### Green

**Green is a great choice when you want to signal positive or affirmative actions.**

Green effectively draws attention to actions that confirm or approve something
in your design. However, consider using different button variants depending on
the context. These variants can emphasise or reduce the importance of the
positive action and help highlight the most crucial action for the user.

<Canvas of={Stories.GreenColorSchemeDesignExample} sourceState="none" />

### Gold

**Gold buttons are often used for actions that require user attention or careful
consideration. They serve as a visual cue for users to proceed with caution.**

However, gold buttons don't convey the same level of urgency or potential
consequences as red buttons. Since their primary function is to complement
other UI elements, they typically don't have a solid variant like other button
types used for primary actions. You could also see them in the context of a
form.

<Canvas of={Stories.GoldColorSchemeDesignExample} sourceState="none" />

### Grey

**Grey buttons excel at providing subtle calls to action when you want the button
to blend in with the background and not compete for attention with other design
elements.**

This approach is particularly useful in colour-heavy designs or when
you want to emphasise other elements or actions in your design. For example,
grey buttons can be used for secondary actions or as building blocks within
other UI components.

<Canvas of={Stories.GreyColorSchemeDesignExample} sourceState="none" />

## Inverted

The inverted property is a boolean value. Setting it to true triggers an
inversion of the original colorScheme of the Button. In essence, if the
original colour scheme was optimised for a light background, the inverted
property will adjust the button's colours to function effectively on a darker
background.

To learn more about inverted colour schemes in components please refer to the
[naming conventions document](https://wiki.uw.systems/posts/naming-conventions-and-stack-mirroring-z1olqysr#hz3pw-color-schemes).

<Canvas of={Stories.InvertedColour} sourceState="none" />

## Size

The size prop helps you create a clear hierarchy and guide users towards the
most important actions in your design layout. All button variants and colour
schemes can be used with various sizes, giving you maximum flexibility.

### Small

Small buttons are perfect for subtle interactions, allowing you to offer
additional functionality without overwhelming users with prominent calls to
action.

### Medium

Medium buttons are best for emphasising crucial actions. They
effectively grab user attention, making them ideal for situations where a
specific action is the core function of a page or a large section. As the
default size, medium buttons strike a perfect balance between prominence,
usability, and provide a comfortable target area for touch interactions.

## State

Buttons have different states to provide visual feedback to users and indicate interaction possibilities.

- In Figma, properties represent different states of a component (e.g., hover, focus).
- In code, interactive components have built-in states that can be styled (e.g., active, disabled).

| State    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default  | This is the button's resting state when the user isn't interacting with it.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Hover    | When the user hovers their mouse cursor over the button, it enters the hover state.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Active   | The active state is triggered when the user activates the button. When using a mouse, "activation" typically starts when the user presses down the primary mouse button. This state visually indicates that the button is being pressed and an action is about to happen. |
| Focus    | This state applies when the user navigates to the button using the keyboard's Tab key, and it becomes the currently focused element.                                                                                                                                      |
| Disabled | This state is used when a button action is unavailable or not applicable in the current context. Disabled buttons do not respond to hover or click states, but are still focusable via the keyboard.                                                                      |

## Icons

Icons can sometimes serve as visual shortcuts, supporting the button text and
helping users to identify the button's function and the anticipated result of
clicking it.

Each icon prop (iconLeft and iconRight) offers customization options for the
button's appearance. It is important to note that due to design limitations,
you can only choose to have an icon positioned either to the left or right of
the button text, not both.

**If you have to use a button with only an icon, please use the Icon Button component.**

<Canvas of={Stories.WithIcons} sourceState="none" />

## Autolayout config (Figma only)

Buttons in Figma have built-in auto-layout capabilities that allow you to
easily adjust their size to fit your design needs.

**Hug Content** - By default, buttons use the "Hug Content" layout, where the
button width automatically adapts to the width of its text content.

**Full-Width Buttons** - You can create full-width buttons, typically
recommended for large sizes. To achieve this:

- Select the button frame.
- In the Properties panel (right-hand side), locate the "Layout" section.
- Under "Sizing," change the option from "Hug Content" to "Fill Container".
- Ensure the button is placed within a container frame set to either "Fixed" or "Hug Content" layout/container.

## Best Practices

- For clarity, use clear and concise Button text that accurately reflects the action it triggers.
- Provide visual hierarchy; use button sizes, colours, and variants according to importance and meaning.
- Avoid overwhelming users with too many buttons, this can lead to confusion and decision fatigue.

## Customisation and overrides

The buttons offer a diverse range of sizes, variants, and colour schemes,
catering to a multitude of design scenarios. **It's important to remember that
these options address core functionalities, and may not encompass every unique
design need or context.** Since the button designs dictate properties like
colour usage, **local overrides are generally discouraged**. If you encounter
design limitations or believe a new button variant or size is necessary, please
don't hesitate to share your feedback with the Design Systems team.
