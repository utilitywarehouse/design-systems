## Accessibility

Uses a native `<button>` element under the hood, with support for the <kbd>Space</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd> keys.

Disabled buttons use `aria-disabled` so that they are still focusable when
using the keyboard. This means that screen readers are still able to find the
button, however the `onClick` handler will be disabled.

### Known issues

We are aware that the `cyan` background colour for the `solid` variant does not
meet colour contrast standards. There is an ongoing discussion with the Brand
and Creative team about how we can replace this with an accessible colour which
does not undermine the brand design.

## Variant

The variant prop controls the visual appearance of the Button.

```tsx
<Flex gap={2} align="center">
  <Button variant="solid">Button</Button>
  <Button variant="outline">Button</Button>
  <Button variant="ghost">Button</Button>
</Flex>
```

### Solid

Solid buttons are typically used for primary actions that require high emphasis.

The solid button can be combined with the `cyan`, `red` & `green` colour schemes.

<Canvas of={Stories.SolidVariant} />

### Outline

Outline buttons typically have a medium level of emphasis. They are best suited
for non-critical actions.

The outline button can be combined with all colour schemes.

<Canvas of={Stories.OutlineVariant} />

### Ghost

Ghost buttons are designed to have a lower prominence compared to the other
button variants. They are initially invisible until interacted with, when
their background becomes visible, on hover and other states. This makes them
suitable for actions that are not as important as the primary one and also
allows them to be used as building blocks for other components.

The ghost button can be combined with all colour schemes.

<Canvas of={Stories.GhostVariant} />

## Color schemes

The `colorScheme` prop will change the button colours. Be aware there are some
combinations of `colorScheme` & `variant` that do not work together (ie. `solid` &
`grey`), and if used will render a button with no colours at all.

```tsx
<Button colorScheme="red">
```

### Cyan

Cyan serves as the default colour scheme for primary actions.

### Green

The green button colour scheme is ideal for indicating positive or affirmative
actions. This colour can be used when you want to draw attention to actions that
confirm or approve something.

### Red

The red colour scheme is most suitable for destructive actions that could result
in data loss, are irreversible, or will have significant and negative
consequences for the user. It serves as a visual warning to approach such
actions with caution due to their potential substantial impact.

### Gold

Gold buttons are commonly linked to actions that demand user attention or
decision-making. They serve as a signal to users that they should proceed with
care. However, it's important to note that gold buttons don't convey the same
level of urgency or potential consequences as red buttons do.

### Grey

The grey colour scheme is best suited for situations where you want the button
to have very low prominence. It's especially useful in designs that are
colour-heavy, as it allows the button to blend in with the overall colour scheme,
making it less visually prominent.

## Inverted colours

When inside a `Box` component that specifies a `background` which is the value
of either `colorsCommon.brandMidnight` or `colorsCommon.brandPrimaryPurple`,
the `Button` component colours will be changed to an inverted colour set. This
can also be achieved using the `inverted` prop.

<Canvas of={Stories.InvertedColour} />

## Size

The size prop controls the size of the `Button`. This is a responsive prop and
can be used to display different sizes at different breakpoints.

<Canvas of={Stories.Sizes} />

```tsx
<Button
  size={{
    mobile: 'small',
    desktop: 'medium',
  }}
/>
```

## With icons

You can nest icons directly inside the `Button`. An appropriate gap is provided
automatically, and the icon will inherit the appropriate colours.

This button is intended to be used with the [UW Icons](https://uw-icons.vercel.app/) packages.
All links should use the small (16px) icons.

<Canvas of={Stories.SimpleExample} />

```tsx
<Button variant="solid" size="medium">
  Continue
  <ChevronRight01SmallIcon />
</Button>
```

Icons from the UW icons packages have `aria-hidden="true"` set by default. If
you are using an icon from outside these packages, and for purely decorative
reasons, please ensure it has this attribute set so that the icon is hidden
from screen readers.

Please also add the `data-icon` attribute to your icon so that it renders the
appropriate styles.

```tsx
<Button>
  <MyFontIcon aria-hidden="true" data-icon />
  Edit account
</Button>
```

## Semantic HTML

> If it goes somewhere it's a link, if it does something it's a button.

A semantic HTML `button` is rendered by default, however you can change the
underlying HTML element by using the `asChild` prop.

When `asChild` is set to true, we will not render a default DOM element,
instead cloning the child and passing it the props and behaviour required to
make it functional.

Read more about this idea in the [Radix UI composition docs](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/guides/composition).

<Canvas of={Stories.AsLink} />

```tsx
<Button asChild>
  <a href="https://uw.co.uk/services">View UW services</a>
</Button>
```

## Full Width Button

Use layout components, like `Flex`, to define your UI layouts, which can also be responsive.

<Canvas of={Stories.FullWidth} />

```tsx
<Flex direction="column">
  <Button>Button</Button>
</Flex>

<Flex direction="column" align={{ mobile: 'stretch', desktop: 'start' }}>
  <Button>Responsive Button</Button>
</Flex>
```

## Usage with Next.js

### Next.js v13

The Next.js `Link` component behaviour has changed in v13, so that an `<a>` is
no longer required as a child. You can render the Web UI `Button` component as a
Next.js `Link` component using `asChild`:

```tsx
import NextLink from 'next/link';
import { Button } from '@utilitywarehouse/web-ui';

[...]

<Button asChild onClick={onClick}>
  <NextLink href={href}>{title}</NextLink>
</Button>
```

You can also use the `legacyBehavior` prop directly on the Next.js Link component:

```tsx
import NextLink from 'next/link';
import { Button } from '@utilitywarehouse/web-ui';

[...]

<NextLink href={href} passHref legacyBehavior>
  <Button {...props} asChild onClick={onClick}>
    <a href={href as string}>{title}</a>
  </Button>
</NextLink>
```

And if you want to set this behavior globally you can use the following Next.js
configuration:

```
{
  experimental: {
    newNextLinkBehavior: false
  }
}
```

### Next.js before v13

```tsx
import NextLink from 'next/link';
import { Button } from '@utilitywarehouse/web-ui';

[...]

<NextLink href={href} passHref>
  <Button {...props} asChild onClick={onClick}>
    <a href={href as string}>{title}</a>
  </Button>
</NextLink>
```
